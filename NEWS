CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0 (2011-04, bioconductor release 2.8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    - Complete rewrite, making the current GSRI package largely
      incompatible with any GSRI 1.*.* version

    - All results are now stored in an object of class 'Gsri'
      which is central for all the analysis in the package.

    - All user-relevant interfaces are now methods using the S4
      class system.

    - The method 'gsri' is central for all analyses and includes
      capabilities of the deprecated 'gsriFromFile' and 'gsri'
      functions. The capability of the 'gsriFromFile' function in
      reading data files has been moved to the 'read*'
      methods. The capabilities for plotting, exporting to files
      etc. of the 'gsri' and 'gsriFromFile' functions has been
      moved to dedicated methods.

    - Bootstrapping of group labels has been replaced by
      bootstrapping expression intensities within groups.

    - The internal functionality of the 'GSRI' package has mainly
      been replaced by the 'les' package, including new features
      such as weighting.

    - Gene set can be defined using the classes of the 'GSEABase'
      package

    - Function for reading .gmt files has been dropped in favor
      of 'getGmt' of the 'GSEABase' package

    - Change of nearly all argument names


NEW FEATURES

    - New vignette documenting new features

    - Support for parallelized computing using the 'multicore'
      package

    - Weighting of genes in gene set possible
